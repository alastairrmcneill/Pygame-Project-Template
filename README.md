# Pygame Project Template
## About
This is my custom project template for starting any new pygame projects. It is build to be scalable in terms of the number of scenes that are present in the game. Currently it is using the state machine architecture with the Manager class being used to organise the code. Each custom scene should inherit from the default scene to ensure fucntionality is consistent between scenes.   
Compoents`Components` folder is there to hold any supporting classes or functions.
Fonts folder is there to hold any custom fonts that are required for the game to run properly.
Imgs folder is there to hold any custom images that are required for the game to run properly.

## Requirements
